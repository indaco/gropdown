## v0.1.2 - 2025-04-02

[compare changes](https://github.com/indaco/gropdown/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2)

**No functional or API-level changes are introduced in this release.**

The main improvement in this release is a packaging optimization:

- The demo.gif file previously embedded in the main branch has been moved to a separate repos.
- This change ensures that users installing the module no longer download the demo asset, resulting in reduced disk usage and faster installs.
